## **12-Month Roadmap for First Year**

### **Month 1: Improving Code Quality and Setting Best Practices**

#### **Objectives:**
- **Set Coding Standards**: Make sure the whole team follows the same rules for naming files, organizing code, and formatting.
- **Start Refactoring**: Improve old code to make it cleaner, easier to read, and less confusing.
- **Set Up Testing**: Make sure the code has automated tests that check if everything works properly.

#### **Actions:**
- **Coding Standards**:
   - Create a document that lists the rules for writing code. For example, how to name variables, classes, and methods.
   - **Why**: This will help make the code more consistent and easier for anyone to understand, especially when you come back to a piece of code months later.

- **Refactoring**:
   - Go through the code and find parts that are messy or overly complicated. Simplify them.
   - **Why**: Clean code is easier to maintain and less likely to cause bugs in the future.

- **Set Up Testing**:
   - Use tools like **RSpec** and **FactoryBot** to automatically test the code. Write tests for new features and fix old ones.
   - **Why**: Automated tests help catch mistakes early and ensure that new code doesn't break existing functionality.

### **Month 2: Modularizing the Code (Breaking the Code Into Smaller Parts)**

#### **Objectives:**
- **Make the Code More Modular**: Split large pieces of code into smaller, reusable parts. This will make the code easier to maintain and update.
- **Introduce CQRS (Small-Scale)**: Start separating the code that writes data (commands) from the code that reads data (queries). This will help keep things organized.

#### **Actions:**
- **Modular Design**:
   - Break large components (like big controllers or classes) into smaller pieces with clearly defined responsibilities.
   - **Why**: Small, focused parts of the code are easier to test, debug, and reuse. For example, instead of having a huge controller handle many actions, you can break it into service objects that handle specific tasks.

- **CQRS Introduction**:
   - Implement a small version of **CQRS** to separate the "commands" (things that change data) from the "queries" (things that read data).
   - **Why**: This helps with organizing the code better. For example, you might have one part of the code that handles creating new messages (write commands) and another that reads messages (queries). This makes the code easier to understand and scale later on.

### **Month 3: Improving Performance**

#### **Objectives:**
- **Find and Fix Slow Areas**: Use tools to find parts of the app that are slow and improve them.
- **Start Caching**: Store frequently used data temporarily to make the app faster.

#### **Actions:**
- **Profiling and Fixing Bottlenecks**:
   - Use tools like **New Relic** or **Rails' built-in tools** to find slow parts of the code, like long database queries or pages that take too long to load.
   - **Why**: Faster apps are more enjoyable to use and reduce server costs.

- **Caching**:
   - Store data that doesn’t change often (like user profiles) in memory using **Redis** or other caching tools.
   - **Why**: Caching improves speed by avoiding repeated database queries for the same data.

---

### **Month 4: Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**

#### **Objectives:**
- **Create Documentation**: Write clear documentation about how the code works, how to use the APIs, and how to fix problems.
- **Code Reviews**: Set up a system where team members can review each other's code to ensure it's high-quality.

#### **Actions:**
- **Create Documentation**:
   - Write clear guides and explanations for how the system works and how new developers can get started.
   - **Why**: Good documentation helps new team members understand the project quickly and helps everyone avoid making the same mistakes.

- **Code Reviews**:
   - Set up a system where developers review each other’s code before it gets added to the main project.
   - **Why**: Code reviews help catch bugs early and let team members learn from each other.

---

### **Month 5: Automating the Development Process (CI/CD)**

#### **Objectives:**
- **Set Up CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate testing and deployment so that changes to the code are automatically tested and deployed to servers.
- **Add Monitoring**: Set up tools to track the health and performance of the app.

#### **Actions:**
- **CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Set up a pipeline that automatically runs tests and deploys code using tools like **CircleCI** or **GitHub Actions**.
   - **Why**: CI/CD speeds up development by making sure everything works and is deployed without human errors.

- **Monitoring**:
   - Set up tools like **Datadog** or **New Relic** to track the app’s performance and alert you if something goes wrong.
   - **Why**: Monitoring ensures you can fix problems before users notice them.

---

### **Month 6: Preparing for Scalability (Handling More Users)**

#### **Objectives:**
- **Plan for Scalability**: Look at the app’s architecture and plan how to handle more users in the future.
- **Load Testing**: Simulate a lot of users using the app to see how it performs under heavy load.

#### **Actions:**
- **Scalability Review**:
   - Assess the current system and look for places where it might break if the number of users grows a lot.
   - **Why**: It's better to fix scalability problems before they become real issues.

- **Load Testing**:
   - Simulate thousands of users using the app at once to see if it can handle the load.
   - **Why**: Load testing ensures that the app will work well even when there are many users.

---

### **Month 7-9: Advanced Features and Refining the Code**

#### **Objectives:**
- **Feature Flags**: Implement feature flags to control when new features are turned on or off.
- **Security Improvements**: Improve security by reviewing authentication and ensuring data is protected.

#### **Actions:**
- **Feature Flags**:
   - Use **feature flags** to control when certain features should be turned on or off, without deploying new code.
   - **Why**: Feature flags allow you to test new features safely and gradually.

- **Security Improvements**:
   - Review the app’s security and improve features like login (e.g., add two-factor authentication).
   - **Why**: Security is important to protect sensitive user data.

---

### **Month 10-12: Optimizing and Building More Reliable Infrastructure**

#### **Objectives:**
- **Database Optimization**: Improve the database design and query performance to keep things fast as the app grows.
- **Analytics and Insights**: Start tracking user actions and behavior to make data-driven decisions.

#### **Actions:**
- **Database Optimization**:
   - Refactor slow database queries and add indexes to speed up data retrieval.
   - **Why**: A fast database ensures that the app works smoothly even with lots of data.

- **Data Analytics**:
   - Start collecting data on how users are interacting with the app (using tools like **Google Analytics** or **Mixpanel**).
   - **Why**: This helps make smarter decisions about what features to improve or add.

---

### **Ongoing Activities:**

- **Regular Team Meetings**: Meet with your team every two weeks to review progress, adjust plans, and address any challenges.
- **Feedback Loop**: Encourage team members to provide feedback on how things are going, what could be improved, and where new ideas could help.

---

### **Adjusting the Roadmap**:

As you progress through the year, the order of these activities may change depending on what’s most important for the team. Sometimes, you may need to shift focus based on urgent issues, business needs, or team priorities.

---

### **Summary of Goals**:
- **Code Quality**: Refactor the code and set up automated tests.
- **Modular Design**: Break up the code into smaller parts to make it more maintainable.
- **Performance**: Identify and fix slow areas in the app.
- **Scalability**: Plan ahead for growth and make the app ready for more users.
- **Security**: Keep the app secure and protect user data.
- **Automation**: Implement automated tests and deployment to save time and reduce errors.

This plan is about setting a strong foundation and gradually improving the application to be faster, easier to maintain, and ready for future growth.
